Installing
----------

Install and update using <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/">`pip`</a>:

```console
$ pip install -U epure
```

Install and update using <a href="https://python-poetry.org/docs/">`poetry`</a>:

```console
$ poetry add epure@latest
```

A Simple Epurized Class Example
----------------

Let's start with simple example for Epure, you will need your DataBase to be up and running.
We will be using PostgresSQL for this example.

!!! warning "Type Hinting Required!"
    Note that you need to use __type hints__ for class attributes in order to save class to DB. Class attribute without a type-hint will not be saved in DB.

    If you dont know which type-hint you want to use, but still want to save your field: use `#!python object` type-hint and your instance will be saved as `#!js JSON`.

    Read more about supported types for type-hinting :arrow_right: <a href="https://epurelib.github.io/latest/learn/epure_essentials/supported_types.md">here</a> :arrow_left:

### Connect it

Connect Epure to your DB:

```python hl_lines="1 8 15 18 27 33"
from epure import epure, escript, GresDB
from ..epure.generics import NotNull # (1)!
from typing import List, Dict

GresDb('postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432',
log_level=3).connect() # (2)!
```

1. Check out more about generic Epure types here: link
2. Format of string to connect ('database://user:password@host:port'); Note that there is two ways to connect to db, read here:

!!! tip "GresDB and supported DB's"
    Read more about GresDB class and supported by Epure DataBases :arrow_right: <a href="https://epurelib.github.io/latest/learn/supported_db/#supported-dbs-for-epure">here</a> :arrow_left:

### Define it

<!-- Define a class that you want to save as a table: -->

We will define four classes: 

 - three of them (`Publication`,`Reporter`,`Publisher`) will serve as subordinate classes 
 
 - and the one main, supreme class `Article` that will accumulate instances of these other classes: 

```python hl_lines="20"
# base class for Article
@epure()
class Publication:
    text_style: str = "scientific"

@epure()
class Reporter:
    full_name: str = "Victor Bennet"

class Publisher:
    publisher_name = "Future CodeWeave"

@epure() # (1)!
class Article(Publication):
    # text_style: str = "scientific" # inherits
    reporter: Reporter
    title: str
    times_published: NotNull[int] = 3
    authors: List[str] = ["Charles Dickens", "Frank Herbert"]
    publisher: object = Publisher()

    def __init__(self, reporter, title):
        self.reporter = reporter
        self.title = title

    def get_articles_using_kwargs():

        articles = self.resource.read(times_published=5) # -> [<Article object at 0x0...>, <Article object at 0x2...>]

        return articles[0]

```

1. `#!python @epure` is metaclass decorator function, that modifies class; more info here: 


!!! info "Supported by Epure type-hint types"
    Read more about supported types for type-hinting :arrow_right: <a href="https://epurelib.github.io/latest/learn/epure_essentials/epure_cls/#supported-types-for-type-hinting-class-attributes">here</a> :arrow_left:

??? tip ":magic_wand: _Magic_ :magic_wand: method and _smart queries_"
    Read more about :magic_wand: _magic_ :magic_wand: methods and `#!python @escript` decorator :arrow_right: <a href="https://epurelib.github.io/latest/learn/epure_essentials/escript_decorator/#magic-escript-decorator">here</a> :arrow_left:

!!! question "`#!py object` type in type-hinting of a class"
    The `Article` class has a field `publisher`, and is initialized by instance of not _epurized_ class, so if we dont know by which type we want to save an object like __this__ - we can simply type hint it by `#!py object` type!
### Save it

Create and save instances of your class as such:

```python
my_reporter = Reporter()

article_one = Article(my_reporter, "Why Epure is the best ORM?")
article_one.save()

article_two = Article(my_reporter, "Why Eset is so magnificent?")
article_two.save()
```

### Retrieve it

Now when your instances saved in DB table named `#!sql public.article`, we can talk about __creating__ __queries__ __variations__:

### 1. _Smart_ queries with use of `#!python @escript` magic method :star_struck:

!!! question "Bit of `#!py @escript`, `Model` and `Resource` theory üßê"

    Method itself becomes magical after we decorated it with `#!python @escript`. Every "epurized"(1) class has its `Model` and `Resource`.
    { .annotate }

    1. "epurized" class - is `#!py class` that was decorated by `@epure()` decorator

    `Resource` is a field of `#!py class` that contains __all__ saved instances of this `#!py class`. 

    `Model` is used to get data from `Resource`. With use of `Model`, we can address fields of class to construct _smart_ queries üòÑ

!!! info "Smart query is a predicate"
    _Smart query_ is a predicate (logic expression), which is used to filter objects, hence every logic expression can be used as part of _smart query_, e.g. filtering by `#!py True` will return __all__ objects from `Resource`

!!! Warning 
    Currently it is only possible to initialize query by `#!sql True` or `#!sql False`, as shown in example below.

<!-- Let's do some magic  : -->
We will define a :magic_wand: _magic_ :magic_wand: method `get_articles` for `#!py class Article`

Imagine if we want to get all stored articles with names that are defined in `#!py list` of title names:
```py linenums="1"
...
@escript # (1)!
def get_articles(self):

    model = self.md # (2)!

    title_names = ["Why Epure is the best ORM?", "Why Elist is so powerfull?", "What is magic method?"]
```

1. `#!python @escript` is method decorator for @epure decorated classes; more info here:
2. note that md (short for `#!python Model`) is only available in @escript decorated method scope and only; more info here: 


<!-- One way is if we want to use `#!py for` cycle, then we need to __explicitly initialize__ our `query` by `#!py False` statement, 
this way `#!py False` will be our starting point in building of _smart_ query
and therefore start of combinining these titles one by one using `#!py or` -->

Here you can see example for using logical expression with _smart query_:

```py linenums="8"
    query = False

    for name in title_names:
        query = query or model.title == name
```
By using `#!py in` we will get same result üòÉ:
```py linenums="12"
    query = model.title in title_names # (1)!
```

1. read more about supported SQL operators in `#!python Epure` like `#!python in` here:


Passing _smart_ query then to `#!python .read()` will retrieve `Reporter` object(s) with `title` value either: `#!python "Why Epure is the best ORM?"`,  `#!python "Why Elist is so powerfull?"` or `#!py "What is magic method?"`.
```py linenums="13"

    articles = self.resource.read(query) # (1)!

    return articles
...
```

1. learn more about `#!python read()` here:

`Resource` implements CRUD interface, you can create (`.create()`), update (`.update()`), delete (`.delete()`) and read (`.read()`).

And calling `#!python .smart_query_example()`, our :magic_wand: _magic_ :magic_wand: method will return your retrieved object. ‚ú® Viola! ‚ú®

<!-- Calling this method we are reading data from resource and we will get Epure objects as result -->


```python hl_lines="1"
my_articles = article_one.get_articles() # -> [<Article object at 0x0...>, <Article object at 0x2...>]

my_articles[0].reporter # -> <Reporter object at 0x0...>
my_articles[0].title # -> "Why Epure is the best ORM?"
```

### 2. Shortcut :material-arrow-right-top-bold: `#!py read()` with `#!py **kwargs` parameters

<!-- Alternatively if you: -->

<!-- - know attribute by which you want to get set of objects -->

<!-- - have `data_id` (`#!python UUID`) of specific object -->

<!-- you can use `.read()` method that takes key-word arguments and allows this ready to hand approach of getting objects -->

<!-- ```python hl_lines="4 9" -->

<!-- article_one_data_id = article_one.data_id # -> UUID4 # (1)! -->

<!-- # reading by unique data_id of article will return one object -->
<!-- my_articles = obj1.table.read(data_id=article_one_data_id)[0] # -> [<Article object at 0x0...>] -->

<!-- # or by kwargs -->

<!-- # multiple attrs of article -->
<!-- my_articles = Article.resource.read(str_attr="Why Epure is the best ORM?", times_published=3) # -> [[<Article object at 0x0...,>, ...]] -->

<!-- my_articles[0].reporter # -> <Reporter object at 0x0...> -->
<!-- my_articles[0].title # -> "Why Epure is the best ORM?" -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- 1. data_id is a unique UUID object identifier that Epure uses to discriminate different objects -->

Elist and Eset: easy store, easy load collections
-----
!!! quote "What is Elist and Eset"
    Elist and Eset is {==__super convinient__==} when: you want to store your items in just a regular `#!py list` or `#!py set`...

    &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; ...but at the same time in DB üòã

### Elist



<!-- Elist is really convenient in terms of using easy retrievable data collection. -->

<!-- Elist is really convenient in terms of using easy savable and retrievable data collection. -->

<!-- You can look at `Elist` like __strictly typed__ `#!py list` with mechanism of simple saving :material-download: and retrieving :material-upload: its contents from DB. -->

`Elist` - is simple tool to store small collections in single-user aplications.

You can look at `Elist` like generic __strictly typed__ `#!py list` with mechanism of easy saving :material-download: and retrieving :material-upload: its contents from DB.

`Elist` is a __strictly typed__ `#!py list` because it can only store instances of subscripted (defined) for `Elist` type 
({==e.g==} `#!py Elist[str]` __can't__ store `#!py int` value)

!!! danger "`Elist` is not multiuser-friendly"

    <!-- `Elist` can guarantee numerated order of objects when is used by user at a time -->

    `Elist` __does not__ guarantee numerated order of __big collections__ in __multi-user__ aplications.

    In cases of __big collections__ with multiple users use <a href="https://epurelib.github.io/latest/#eset">`Eset`</a>!

<!-- Elist comes real handy when you want to store your instances in DB using just a regular python list :exploding_head: -->


Let's look at an example:
???+ example "`Elist` example for storing and retrieving items"
    We will create `House` and `District` classes. Both `House` and `District` will store a `Elist`.
    ```python hl_lines="10 19"
    from epure import epure, Elist

    @epure()
    class House:
        tenant_names:Elist[str]
        house_number:int
        street_name:str

        def __init__(self, house_number, street_name, tenant_names):
            self.house_number = house_number
            self.street_name = street_name
            self.tenant_names = tenant_names

    @epure()
    class District:
        houses_list:Elist[House]

    ```
    After we will create two instances of `House`, add them to `houses_list` (`Elist`) of `District` obj and save all them.
    ??? question "Saving object with `Elist` or `Eset` field"
        Note that saving object with `Elist` field will triger saving for all `Elist` or `Eset` fields of this object respectivly.
    ```py

    house_one = House(42, "Crow Str.", Elist[str](["Mary", "Charles"]))

    house_two = House(14, "Babbidge Str.", Elist[str](["Daniel"]))

    district = District()
    district.houses_list = Elist[House]([house_one, house_two])

    district.save() # (1)!

    ```
    
    1. Saving this Epure instance with Elist field will triger saving for Elist

    Then using `.read()` we will get our `District` object from DB (`district_retrived`) using `district.data_id` (unique `UUID` id).
    `House` objects will be already present in `house_list` `Elist`
    ```py

    district_retrived = District.resource.read(data_id = district.data_id)

    district_retrived[0].houses_list[0] # -> [<House object at 0x0...>]
    district_retrived[0].houses_list[0].tenant_names[0] # -> "Mary"
    ```
    Working with `Elist` collection is really easy as you can see in this example


!!! info "How to store `Elist` outside of class, more examples and etc."
    How to store Elist outside class field, examples on Elist :arrow_right: <a href="https://epurelib.github.io/latest/learn/elist_eset/#elist">here</a> :arrow_left:

### Eset

`Eset` is similar to <a href="https://epurelib.github.io/latest/#elist">`Elist`</a>, __though__ (as much as `#!py set` differes from `#!py list`) `Eset` has no order of its stored contents.

<!-- `Eset` {==__is convenient__==} in cases when you need store big chunks of data in a collection -  -->

Because of the way `Eset` is built, it {==__is really convenient__==} when working with big chunks of data! ü§§

You dont need to load whole Eset at a time: when `Eset` is retrived from DB - it will be empty by `#!js default` and is easily loaded by `.load()` method.

(In future Eset will support partial loading, based on specified properties of objects)

<!-- Then you can easily retrieve part of data stored in it based on kwargs (or other params) s -->

In a way, `Eset` is Epure's interpretation of Many2Many field.


???+ example "Eset with `#!js JSON` example for storing, loading and retrieving items"
    Let's declare `Customer` and `ShipmentCompany`. 
    
    Because `ShipmentCompany.customers_set` `Elist` type is `#!py object` - instances of `Customer` will be stored as `#!js JSON`
    ```python hl_lines="1 18 20 22 28 32" 
    from epure import epure, Eset

    class Customer:
        name:str
        adress:str

        def __init__(self, name, adress):
            self.name = name
            self.adress = adress

    @epure()
    class ShipmentCompany:
        customers_set:Eset[object]
        offices_names:Eset[str] = Eset[str](["Charlie", "Bravo", "Alpha"])

    ```
    
    `Eset` allows to store {==copious==} amounts of data, so __lets load it up__!
    ??? success "Storing loads of instances in `big_customers_set`"
        ```py
        customer_1 = Customer("Sion Mccall", "Heathfield Road, 30")
        customer_2 = Customer("Darcy Montes", "Ash Street, 13")
        customer_3 = Customer("Isaiah Hughes", "Grasmere Avenue, 19")
        customer_4 = Customer("Jodie Sandoval", " Meadow Rise, 15")
        ...
        ...
        ...
        customer_50 = Customer("Emily Mahoney", "Park Road, 62")
        customer_51 = Customer("Inaaya Hodge", "Rectory Lane, 42")
        customer_52 = Customer("Blanche Colon", "Ferndale Road, 10")
        customer_54 = Customer("Lucia Davenport", "Warwick Street, 56")
        customer_55 = Customer("Vivian Lin", "Carlton Road, 23")
        customer_56 = Customer("Kane Flores", "Beaufort Road, 87")

        big_customers_set = Eset[object]([customer_1, ..., customer_56])
        ```
    
    We will create our `shipment_company` and assign `big_customers_set` to its `customers_set`, then we will save it

    ```py
    shipment_company = ShipmentCompany()

    shipment_company.customers_set = big_customers_set

    shipment_company.save() # (1)!

    ```
    Retriving is easily done with `read()`, and as you can see you need to `load()` `Eset` for it to be sub-loaded.

    ```py
    retrieved_shipment_company = EsetExample.resource.read(data_id = eset_ex.data_id)[0]

    empty_eset = retrieved_shipment_company.customers_set # -> {}
    loaded_set = empty_eset.load() # (2)!
    loaded_set # -> {<Customer object at 0x0...>, <Customer object at 0x0...>, ...}

    empty_set = retrieved_shipment_company.offices_names # -> {}
    loaded_set = empty_set.load() # (2)!
    " ".join(loaded_set) # -> "Alpha Charlie Bravo"
    ```

    1. Note that saving this will triger recursive saving for all elists and esets bounded to this object
    2. Eset is empty when is retrieved, you need to use .load() method of Eset to fill the eset with its content.

`#!js JSON` and `#!py dict` serialization and deserialization of Epure objects
-----

Epure allows to __serialize__ your "epurized" class `#!python object` to `#!js JSON` using `.to_dict()` and `.to_json()` methods 

As much as it allows to __deserialize__ `#!js JSON` back to a Epure `#!python object` using `.from_dict()` and `.from_json()`

Ini File Parser
-----

This section of library appeared mainly because there is no adequate solution for working with ini files in python

File Ini Parser allows to easily work with sections of `.ini` file using dot (`.`) notation

!!! example "Using Ini File Parser"

    Save this as example.ini file:

    ```ini title="example.ini"
    db_host = localhost

    [general]
    db_port = 5432

    [epure.best.app.forever]
    friend = true
    ```

    Now we can easily access fields of this ini file:

    ```python hl_lines="5 7 9"
    from epure.files import IniFile

    config = IniFile('./example.ini')

    config.db_host # -> "localhost"

    config.general.db_port # -> 5432

    config.epure.best.app.forever.friend # -> True

    ```
